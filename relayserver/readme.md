### Modula

Modula is a flask based (utilizing blueprint) JSON API with a simple logging class, and a Rackspace identity class integrated for acquiring customer tokens.

I wrote this because existing skeletons or projects do not seem to include a dynamically loading modular route based system. This was the result. I would say this is adequite to get most projects started.
